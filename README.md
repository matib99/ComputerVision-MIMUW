# ComputerVision-MIMUW
A repository with my solutions for computer vision tasks at the Computer Vision course at the University of Warsaw 

## Tasks
During the course we had to submit 3 big projects, and a bunch of smaller tasks. In this repository, you can see my solutions for those 3 big tasks:
1. Implementing Simple SSD network for detecting people (and training it)
2. Implementing elements of EfficientDet (and training it), for Edge Aware Segmentation
3. Implementing and training simple Normalizing Flows model for a toy problem of generating number 5 from MNIST. Then, inpainting half-occluded images using trained model.

## Disclaimer
I made a small mistake in the nf_loss function in the task 3 - That mistake, causes low variation in the generated images. I will fix that in my free time. For now, I leave the incorrect version here for the educational purposes.

## Disclaimer 2
If you are from ML degree at MIM UW, please try to do this tasks yourself before looking at my solutions. I know that the deadline is approaching, but those tasks are realy fun, and you can learn a lot from doing them yourself c:
